The following figure gives the first part of Pascal’s triangle:
        1
        11
        121
        1331
        14641
              
The entries of the triangle are called binomial coefficients. The k’th binomial coefficient of the n’th row is denoted
(n/k), for n >= 0 and 0 <= k <= n. For example (2/1)=2 and (4/2) = 6. The first and last binomial coefficients, that is,
(n/0) and (n/n), of row n are both 1. A binomial coefficient inside a row is the sum of the two binomial coefficients immediately above it. These properties
can be expressed as follows:  

*)

let rec bin (n,k) = 
    match (n,k) with 
    | (n,0) -> 1
    | (n,k) when n=k -> 1
